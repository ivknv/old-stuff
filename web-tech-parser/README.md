web-tech-parser
===============

TechParser as a site on Heroku.

This "app" uses [TechParser](https://github.com/SPython/tech-parser).
It actually has no code.

It's just a template so you can replace ```user_parser_config.py``` with your configuration and deploy this repository to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

Also you'll need to send HTTP requests to your heroku app every 15 minutes or so.
That's because of heroku. You can use some service like [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) to do that.
